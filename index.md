# About Me

I am a graduate student specializing in telecommunication standards, Open RAN, and advanced research on cell offloading and RAN slicing using Game Theory. My work revolves around designing innovative solutions that bridge theory and practical implementation in modern telecom networks.

With a strong focus on standards-driven innovation, I have been contributing to patents and publishing research papers that push the boundaries of wireless communication technologies. My ultimate goal is to become a Telecom Software Engineer and to leave a lasting impact on the industry through cutting-edge research and development.
