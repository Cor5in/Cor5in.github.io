      Aether is an open-source 5G platform for edge computing that runs a cloud-native mobile core (SD-Core) and an O-RAN compatible RAN (SD-RAN) on a Kubernetes-based edge cloud. 
      The platform offers Connectivity-as-a-Service, allowing users to easily scale from small deployments to large multi-site environments through a runtime API (AMP) and DevOps lifecycle management (OnRamp). 
      It also provides flexible deployment options through compatibility with commercial 4G/5G small cells.
